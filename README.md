Final Project - Sahil D

About Me

Hello, my name is Sahil Dayal. I am a junior at Mount Eden High School and this year, I took interest in computer science. Throughout the year, I have learned tons of things about computer science from simply printing out sentences to making full on games! I have learned a lot of the fundamentals and have learned to develop a few games myself with the help of my computer science teacher and the internet.

My Projects

In my portfolio, there are three projects that have been made using HTML, CSS, and JS. With these three coding languages, I have made one pretty cool game, and two cool websites. My three projects are a digital clock, double ball pong, and a color switcher! In the digital clock, its pretty self explanatory, but its just a live clock you can use to check the time in your time zone. Double ball pong is definetly the most interesting, where you play a classic game of pong, except there is two balls which makes it way more intense and fun. This game requires a bit faster reaction times compared to regular pong. Lastly, there is the color switcher. In the color switcher, there will be a button which allows you to shuffle through randomly egenerated hex codes.ALl the hex codes stand for a different color.
In my portfolio, I included a screenshot of my projects and direct links so you can see or test them out for yourself! 

This is my digital portfolio and I hope you enjoy!
