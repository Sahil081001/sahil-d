        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Sahil Dayal. I am a junior in high school and I am taking AP Computer Science Essentials and Principles! Throughout the class, we have worked on multiple projects and I would like to share some of my work with you!</p>

      <section class="project">
        <h2>The Digital Clock</h2>
        <a href="https://codepen.io/SahilD111/pen/bNdNPwW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out the Live Digital Clock!</a>
        <p>This project was the first one we did without our teacher's guidance. The project is quite simple but still pretty neat, check it out in the link above!</p>

      <section class="project">
        <h2>Double Ball Pong</h2>
        <a href="https://codepen.io/SahilD111/pen/RNPNzKr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Play some Double Ball Pong!</a>
        <p>This project was definitely much more difficult than the first. It is a game of pong, but as you can see by the title, it has two balls!</p>

      <section class="project">
        <h2>The Color Switcher</h2>
        <a href="https://codepen.io/SahilD111/pen/RNwBjBV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find Some Colors!</a>
        <p>This project was definitely a step down from the fun game of pong. There are so many colors to see in our color switcher, check it out!</p>
