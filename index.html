    <h2>Double Ball Pong</h2>
    <a href="https://codepen.io/SahilD111/pen/RNPNzKr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Play some Double Ball Pong!</a>
    <p>This project was definitely much more difficult than the first. It is a game of pong, but as you can see by the title, it has two balls!</p>
